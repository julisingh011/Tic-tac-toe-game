# Tic-tac-toe-game
This project is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game in Python where two players can compete against each other. The program provides a menu-driven interface that allows players to:

Start a new game

View the scoreboard

Exit the program

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and players alternately mark the cells with their chosen symbol (X or O). The first player to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the grid is completely filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Key features of this implementation:

Player Input Validation: Ensures only valid moves (1â€“9, unoccupied cells) are allowed.

Win & Draw Detection: Automatically checks winning conditions and draw situations after every move.

Scoreboard Tracking: Maintains player scores across multiple rounds and displays them on request.

Turn Alternation: Alternates which player starts first in the next round.

User-Friendly Menu: Options for playing, checking scores, or exiting.

This program demonstrates the use of functions, dictionaries, lists, loops, and conditional logic in Python. It is a good example of building an interactive game while reinforcing programming fundamentals.
